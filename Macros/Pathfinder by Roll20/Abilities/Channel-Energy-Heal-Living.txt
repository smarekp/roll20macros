The amount of damage healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st ([[[[floor((@{class2_level}+1)/2)]]d6]]). This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.

A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.}}
